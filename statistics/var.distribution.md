# How to look into Distribution of Variables
1. Histogram (helps to see the dispersion)
   1. approximates the normal distribution curve
   2. plot multiple histograms to see the difference
2. Box plots (median, quartile)

# p-value and alpha

1. Null hypothesis
2. Alternative hypothesis  

**Alpha, the significance level, is the probability that you will make the mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis when in fact it is true.  The p-value measures the probability of getting a more extreme value than the one you got from the experiment.  If the p-value is greater than alpha, you accept the null hypothesis.  If it is less than alpha, you reject the null hypothesis.**
